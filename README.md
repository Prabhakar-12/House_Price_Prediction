🏡 House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using multiple machine learning regression algorithms. The dataset consists of various features (like number of rooms, area, location factors, etc.) and the target variable is the price of the house.

We implement and compare the performance of:

    Linear Regression
    Decision Tree Regression
    Random Forest Regression

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

    Preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables).
    Apply different regression models.
    Evaluate and compare model performance.
    Visualize results for better understanding.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features that affect house prices. Example features:

    Area
    Number of Bedrooms
    Number of Bathrooms
    Location
    Year Built
    Lot Size
    Target: House Price

(You can replace these with actual dataset column names.)
⚙️ Tech Stack

    Programming Language: Python 🐍
    Libraries Used:
        numpy
        pandas
        matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
        scikit-learn (for ML models)

🚀 Model Implementation
1️⃣ Linear Regression

    Simple model assuming a linear relationship between features and price.
    Good baseline for comparison.

2️⃣ Decision Tree Regression

    Non-linear model splitting features into branches.
    Can capture complex patterns but prone to overfitting.

3️⃣ Random Forest Regression

    Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
    Provides better accuracy and reduces overfitting.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:

    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    R² Score
